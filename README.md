🐚 Mini OS Shell

📘 Project Overview

Mini OS Shell is a simple command-line shell written in Python that mimics the behavior of a basic Unix shell. It enables users to interact with their system through commands, manage processes, and navigate directories—just like in a real shell environment.

This project serves as both a practical tool and an educational resource for exploring:
- Process management
- Inter-process communication
- Basic shell command execution and error handling

✨ Features

- 🔹 Custom shell prompt
- 📁 `cd` command support to change directories
- 🖥️ Execute shell commands like `ls`, `pwd`, etc.
- ⚙️ Manage processes using Python's `subprocess` module
- ❌ Graceful error handling for invalid inputs and system errors


🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3.
- `os` module – For file and directory manipulation
- `subprocess` module – For running system commands
- Python's built-in exception handling – To catch and manage errors
