# Mini OS Shell

## Project Overview

This project is a simple command-line shell written in Python that mimics the behavior of a basic Unix shell. It allows users to interact with their system, run shell commands, change directories, and manage processes. This shell is built to understand and handle common shell commands such as `cd`, running processes, and basic error handling. It also serves as a learning tool to explore concepts such as process management, inter-process communication, and basic shell functionality.

## Features

- Custom command prompt
- Change directory (`cd`) functionality
- Execute shell commands (like `ls`, `pwd`, etc.)
- Process management via Python's subprocess module
- Handles errors for invalid commands or system issues

## Technologies Used

- Python (version 3.x)
- os module for interacting with the operating system
- subprocess module for executing system commands
- Python's exception handling to gracefully handle errors
